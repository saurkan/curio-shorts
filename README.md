Curio-Shorts, is a creative educational tool that transforms any question into a short, engaging, "TikTok-style" video. Here's how it works:
1. Ask a Question: A user starts by asking a question about any topic, for example, "Why is the sky blue?" or "How does a seed grow into a plant?".
2. Choose a Narrator & Style: They can choose a fun, familiar character like Spider-Man, Barbie, or a cat to be the narrator. They also select a visual art style for the video, such as "Anime," "Comic Book," or "Storybook."
3. AI-Powered Creation: The app uses the Gemini API for two main tasks:
4. AI Songwriter: It first writes a simple, catchy song that explains the answer to the question from the perspective of the chosen character. The AI also suggests a musical style (like "upbeat pop" or "gentle ballad").
5. AI Illustrator: For each line of the song, the AI generates a unique, beautiful illustration that matches the lyrics and the selected art style.
6. Instant Short-Form Video: The app combines the generated images, the song lyrics, background music, and a text-to-speech voiceover into a vertical, scrollable slideshow. The result is a short, educational video that's easy and fun to watch.
